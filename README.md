# Pom & Honey Web Application

Welcome to our Vue.js Project for Project 3 at Texas A&M University.

In our web application, we are using an API that we have created and hosted on Microsoft Azure. The API and backend are responsible for tasks such as storing and retrieving inventory, processing sales transactions, generating reports, and more.
We have also incorporated authentication within our web application using Auth0 for a secure implementation limiting access to part of the website based on the user's role.

This repository is for our point-of-sale system for the Pom & Honey restaurant at Texas A&M University and is designed for customers, servers, and managers to easily navigate different features.
